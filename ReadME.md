AI-Generated Daily Wallpapers Based on Social Media Trends

The project aims to scrape trending keywords from social media platforms daily and use these keywords to generate AI-based wallpapers. The wallpapers will be dynamically updated each day via an online connection. The workflow might involves:

Able to figure out the top 10 most frequent words or phrases, generate 10 wallpapers, and randomly select from the system to update the wallpaper every 3 hours.

Data Collection: Using web scraping or social media APIs (such as Twitter or Reddit) to gather the most popular keywords or topics trending each day.
Keyword Analysis: Processing the collected data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract the most frequent and relevant keywords.
AI-based Wallpaper Generation: Leveraging a text-to-image generation model (such as Stable Diffusion or DALLÂ·E) to create unique wallpapers based on the extracted keywords.
Daily Wallpaper Updates: Setting up a system that connects to the internet daily to download the generated wallpaper and apply it to the user's desktop automatically.
